<h1>Linda's Portfolio</h1>
<p>     I'm Linda, I'll be using code and writing as digital media to express my personal journey and adventures into the big city. I am an Asian American born in New York City. As a student, I enjoy taking breaks after getting done with my work and classes. I like to get absorbed into a story whether a book or game. I personally enjoy going out to events such as art markets and fan events for series that I enjoy. I plan to write and talk about my experience at these outings and possibly interest others to take interest in things and events happening around them. </p>
