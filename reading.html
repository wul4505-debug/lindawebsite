<h1>Reading Response #001: In Plato's Cave</h1>
<p>I think that photography and image making is important to capture key points and can be
used to express something that you might want the viewer to think or imagine based on the
image that you took. I personally mainly take photos of objects like food, for example to show
my friends what I had on a particular day and to get them to be interested in that food item and
maybe go out to try the restaurant for the food item. For these images, I don't do a lot of editing
for color or saturation. The only thing I do is crop the image to have the focus be on the food
item or the atmosphere of the restaurant that I am in. With an image, I could visually represent
what I saw with my own eyes and what I personally experienced in that moment. “A photograph
passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened.” The author writes “photography
develops in tandem with one of the most characteristic of modern activities: tourism… taking
photographs fills the same need for thermos cosmopolitans accumulating photograph-trophies.”
I feel like I do the same thing that is talked about in this passage, the photographs that I take are
using more like momentos to look back on to, to reminisce and remember the moment that the
image was taken. The author uses the word “trophies”, this makes the photographs seem like
rewards for participation, having done something to remember. “Being a professional
photographer can be thought of as naughty, to use Arbus's pop word, if the photographer seeks
out subjects considered to be disreputable, taboo, marginal.” I don't think that I personally fully
resonate with this quote, though I think that reason might be due to me not really taking photos
of myself, the only time I am in a photo is if it is something that has to be done like an
identification photo or if I am with my friends. I believe that it is possible that I have a feeling of
comfortability because I know who will be seeing the photo that is taken of me. There is
sometimes a feeling of vulnerability when I am in a photograph all alone without someone that I
have a connection to. I think this feeling is due to not knowing how I look on the other side of the
camera, worrying about my expression and my pose based on what I'm doing in that one
moment that the photo is taken. “Most subjects photographed, touched by pathos… All
photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another person's
mortality, vulnerability, mutability.” This is because photographs are image captures of moments,
an object at a specific period of time, as time passes, things change. The area that the
photograph was taken might have changed or the object that was the focus has changed. But to
viewers of the photograph, it is a past that they are looking back on, to relive the moment or see
what it was like before things have changed. </p>
